# BIP (Behavior - Interaction - Priority)

BIP is a framework for the component-based design and analysis of software systems. It has been successfully used for modelling and analysis of a variety of case studies and applications, such as performance evaluation, modeling and analysis of TinyOS-based wireless sensor network applications, construction and verification of a robotic system. In the latter, the code generated by the tool-chain along with the BIP engine is used as a controller for the robot. The BIP framework also offers validation techniques for checking essential safety properties.

We present a design studio, developed using the WebGME tool, for the specification of BIP models using architecture diagrams, which is a graphical language that describes architecture styles with rigorous semantics. The WebGME-BIP design studio provides support for graphically defining and checking the consistency of BIP architecture models, integrating component behavior specifications, generating Java code from behavior and architecture specifications, and executing the BIP models with the integrated JavaBIP engine.

## Quick Start
First, install the following:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v4.x.x recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Second, start mongodb locally by running the `mongod` executable in your mongodb installation (you may need to create a `data` directory or set `--dbpath`).

Then, run `webgme start` from the project root to start . Finally, navigate to `http://localhost:8888` to start using the WebGME-BIP design studio!

## Alternative - No installation needed
The design studio can be accessed (read-only) directly [here](https://editor.webgme.org/?project=anastasia%2BBIP&node=%2Ff%2Ft)
, where you can see the Switchable Routes BIP project.

A non-read-only version of the design-studio can be accessed [here](https://editor.webgme.org/?project=demo%2BBIP_test&branch=master&node=%2Ff%2Ft&visualizer=BIPEditor&tab=0&layout=DefaultLayout).

If you would like to create your own, private BIP projects:
1. create a [WebGME account](WebGMEhttp://webgme.org/),
2. create a new project ( 3-minute tutorial for how to [create a project](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR0rmcVFcgY&feature=youtu.be)),
3. use the BIP seed.

## Slower Start
WebGME is a a node.js application that uses mongodb. Ubuntu users can install nodejs and mongodb as follows:

```
sudo apt-get nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo apt-get install mongodb-server
```

`npm` is the Node.js package manager, that will allow you to easily install modules and packages to use with Node.js.

Install the command line interface version of webgme globally to your operating system (so the `webgme start` command will work later):
```
sudo npm install webgme-cli -g
```
(Now, if you run `whereis webgme`, it should give you a location for the executable.)

To clone the repository, first install git (if needed):

```
sudo apt-get install git
```

and then do:

```
cd /home/$USER
git clone https://github.com/anmavrid/webgme-bip.git
```
This makes the 'project root' for the git repo `/home/$USER/webgme-bip` (you can pick a different location for it besides `/home/$USER/` if you'd like).

Start mongodb locally by running the `mongod` executable in your mongodb installation (you may need to create a `data` directory or set `--dbpath`). For example:
```
cd /home/$USER
mkdir bip_data
mongod --dbpath ./bip_data
```
wait until you see a line that says "[initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27017".

Then, in a new terminal window, run `webgme start` from the project root (`webgme-bip`) to start. For example:
```
cd /home/$USER/webgme-bip
webgme start
```

Finally, navigate to `http://localhost:8888` to start using the WebGME-BIP design studio!
```
firefox "https://127.0.0.1:8888/" &
```

As an aside... you can also download and install `webgme` itself locally if you'd like to play around with the basic (non-bip) interface:
```
cd /home/$USER
git clone https://github.com/webgme/webgme.git
cd webgme
npm install
npm start
```
